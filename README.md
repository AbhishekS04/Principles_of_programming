# Principles of Programming

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs developed during my **Principles of Programming** lab sessions. The code demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as control structures, functions, classes, and more.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhishekS04/Principles_of_programming.git
   ```
2. Compile the C++ files with your preferred compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o outputfile
   ./outputfile
   ```

## Updates
I will update this repository every **Friday** with new lab work.
